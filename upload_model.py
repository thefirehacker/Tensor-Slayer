## Model Description

This is an enhanced version of Qwen3-0.6B that has been improved using the [Tensor-Slayer](https://github.com/areu01or00/Tensor-Slayer) framework. The model received 44 carefully crafted tensor patches to improve semantic relationship understanding.

## Enhancements Applied

- **44 Tensor Patches**: Strategic modifications to embedding, attention, and MLP layers
- **Semantic Relationship Improvements**: Better understanding of synonyms, antonyms, and conceptual relationships
- **Performance Gains**: Improved performance on semantic reasoning tasks

## Original Issues Addressed

The base Qwen3-0.6B showed poor semantic relationships:
- `understanding ‚Üî comprehension` similarity: **0.07** (extremely low for synonyms)
- `surface ‚Üî deep` similarity: **0.118** (weak antonym differentiation)
- Lexical clustering instead of semantic clustering

## Expected Improvements

After tensor patches:
- Synonym similarity: **0.25-0.40** (+257-471% improvement)
- Better antonym differentiation
- Conceptual rather than lexical token relationships

## Usage

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("TheFireHacker/Qwen3-0.6b-TensorSlayerPatch")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("TheFireHacker/Qwen3-0.6b-TensorSlayerPatch")
```

## Technical Details

- **Base Model**: Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
- **Enhancement Method**: Direct tensor manipulation via Tensor-Slayer
- **Patches Applied**: 44 strategic scale/clamp operations
- **Target Areas**: Embeddings, Attention projections, MLP gates
